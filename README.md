# Cumulative Table Design

You can read more about this repo [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/thedatasitter/p/i-tried-zach-wilsons-cumulative-table?r=4jdqzp&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true) in my blog post for The Data Sitter.

There I explain how this repo is my implementation of [Zach Wilson's cumulative-table-design repo](https://github.com/DataExpert-io/cumulative-table-design?tab=readme-ov-file).

## Getting started
You'll need [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to use this repo.

Once you have it installed, just `poetry install` it and you're good to go.

If you want to run the scripts, just use `poetry run python <script>.py`
